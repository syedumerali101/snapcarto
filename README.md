      Smooth animations are added in Text Inputs, Buttons. Continue buttons show up only when data is filled into the Text Input fields.

      Toggle Password functionality is set using the icon which follows a smooth animation of icon changing. User can see the password by toggling the eye button. It is used in the signup functionality as well.

- Home Functionality
      Home screen shows email of the user along with the name of it. A logout button is set as well which will open up a popup to confirm if the user wants to log out.

      A smooth horizontal list is added to show user some on going shopping articles which follows a very smooth animation, scalling, transition between items. When items are moving, the background is having the image on its background using the item's image.

- Animation in the screen is followed by Animated from react native. Separate hook of it is set to use the functions anywhere in the app.

- Separate components are made, same helpers, separate hooks because of the readibility of the code in the app.

- React navigation is used for navigating between screens.

Additional Information
